Hey! I’m a postdoctoral researcher in the Psycholinguistics group at the Faculty of Language Science and Technology in the University of the Saarland in Germany. I recently graduated from the Ph. D. program at the Department of Psychologgy, Cornell University, under the supervision of Morten H. Christiansen. My main research interests lie in computational modeling, machine learning and other data analysis techniques applied to the study of language learning and processing. Having a background in Philosophy of Science, I’m also interested in data-driven exploration of scientific activity. I like to tackle these topics with a firm eye on theoretical considerations and the predictions of overarching frameworks.
